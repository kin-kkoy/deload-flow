# Deload Flow - Task Management App

A simple but powerful task management application to help you deload your mind and focus on what's important.

## Features

- **Create & Manage Tasks**: Add tasks with names, urgency, difficulty, and optional deadlines.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are automatically saved in your browser's local storage.
- **Dynamic Task Display**: View your tasks in a clean, organized list.
- **Filtering System**: Easily filter tasks by their urgency or difficulty.
- **Streamline Mode**: A focus mode to show only the most immediate task.
- **Task Lifecycle**: Mark tasks as complete, edit their names, or delete them.
- **Auto-Urgency Calculation**: Let the app automatically adjust a task's urgency based on its deadline.
- **Task Statistics**: Keep track of your productivity with a completed task counter.


## To-Do
TBD: To be decided

- Add "?" information functionality to explain autoUrgency
- Edit functionality = includes editing of urgency (if not autoUrgent) and deadline
- Implement a "scope" property (small, medium, big) to influence the auto-urgency calculation; small = standard calculation, medium = slightly bigger time frame calculation, big = large time frame calculation.
- (TBD) Add a description field for tasks to allow for more detailed notes.
- (TBD cause I still see no point) Add a toggle to show/hide completed tasks from the main view.
------ Bigger Plans ------
- BACKEND TIME!!!! (so that I can actually use it)
- React from time to time
